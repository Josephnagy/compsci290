    <h1>Finla Project Proposal</h1>
    <div>
        <ul> 
            <li> 
                Idea
                <ul> 
                    <li>On a very basic level, I want to create an app that allows users to do two things: analyze their own music and
                    discover new music through Spotify. With respect to analyzing their own music, I’d like users to be able to explore
                    their historical listening habits over time, see changes in their habits, etc. In discovering new music, I’d like to
                    expand the ways in which users can generate new playlists and artists to listen to. Currently, Spotify will generate a
                    Daily Mix for you, or allow you to create similar playlists from existing ones; I want to expand this to allow different
                    types of input variables (for example, allow users to generate playlists based on danceability).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Data sources
                <ul>
                    <li>I plan on using the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/discover/">Spotify developer tools</a> for most of the application. It’s extremely robust and has powerful
                    algorithms to generate all of the data I will</li>
                </ul>
            </li>


            <li>
                Features
                <ul>
                    <li>Users will be able to find new music based on a range of inputs including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Audio features such as danceability, valence, tempo and liveness</li>
                            <li>Songs, artists or albums</li>
                            <li>This can all be done through the Spotify API’s “Get Recommendations” feature. 
                                The documentation or that can be found <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#category-browse">here</a></li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Users will be able to analyze their own listening habits, seeing not only information such as their top artists, songs
                        or genres, but also how audio features such as danceability, valence, tempo and liveness have changed in their music
                        taste</li>
                        <li>o An optional feature would be the ability to share these insights with friends. Both users would have to agree to
                        sharing such data through some sort of “friend” relationship. Users could also have the option to make such information
                        public</li>
                        <li>o Users will be able to save playlists they’ve created directly to the web app and have the option to export it to their
                        own Spotify account</li>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                Schedule
                <ul>
                    <li>Progress Demo 1</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic data visualizations implemented for user’s listening habits</li>
                            <li>Basic recommendation calls to the API based on some inputs (i.e. songs, danceability)</li>
                            <li>Basic styling complete for the page but nothing crazy</li>
                            <li>Have some input collected from possible users about what they like/don’t like and features they might like to see
                            implemented</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Progress Demo 2</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of the data visualization will be complete for user’s listening habits</li>
                            <li>Most recommendation calls to the API based on most inputs.</li>
                            <ul> 
                                <li>I’m assuming I’ll run into issues with certain types of input, as Spotify’s documentation says that some types of
                                inputs may be too specific to generate recommendations. I’m hoping to have a good idea of what is and is not possible by
                                then and have a solution to the issues.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Most styling complete on the page. Enough where I will be able to get user input from having people test the
                            application and tell me what they like / don’t like about the UI</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Progress Demo 3</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Everything related to functionality finished by now. I’d like to spend the time between progress demo 3 and the final
                            project date fixing all of the bugs I might have</li>
                            <li>UI should be complete. I’d like to use the time between progress demo 3 and the final project date getting further
                            input from possible users about the UI and use the next week to incorporate their recommendations.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
            </li>
