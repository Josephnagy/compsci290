    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <p> This data visualization models the ratio of every country’s annual defense spending budget (in USD) compared to the
        number of citizens they have below the poverty line. The purpose of this visualization is to bring into question the
        amount of money countries spend on military defense and suggest such money is used to help lift their citizens out of
        poverty. This data “story” does not support or suggest any specific policy solutions to this phenomenon, but instead
        serves to investigate the relationship between the two values and how it varies across nations.</p>

    <p> The radius of every blue cirlce on the map is directly proportional to the defense-to-poverty-ratio 
        which is calcualted by dividing a country's defense spending budget (in USD) by the number of citizens 
        living below the poverty line.
