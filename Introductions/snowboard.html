                  <p>This was my first time snowboarding! It was a very spontaneous trip that my friends and I planned two weeks before
                  winter break. Despite throwing it together at the last minute, everything worked out great and we had an awesome time.
                  We even got a blizzard while we were there!</p>

              <p>This time I went snowboarding with my uncle and two cousins. Snowboarding in Stratton was the first time I really
              started to feel confidence going down the mountain. Even though it was pretty icy towards the end of the trip, I really
              enjoyed myself.</p>

              trip was extremely memorable for me because I had a fantastic time, but also because this was right before we went into
              the spring COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

              <p>This was the last time I went snowboarding! I took my brother to a very small mountain in Vernon NJ called Mountain
              Creek. It was his first time snowboarding, but after only a few runs on the bunny hill, he was ready to try out the
              greens! Even though most of the runs were closed due to COVID-19 restrictions we had a great time getting out of the
              house for a few days.</p>
